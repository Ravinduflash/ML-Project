# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster project

## Introduction
This repository contains a project that applies statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to the well-known **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** competition dataset. The goal of this project is to build predictive models to classify passenger survival outcomes based on various attributes.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the practical application of data science techniques, combining exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning to predict survival on the Titanic. The goal is to identify key variables influencing survival and to develop models that accurately classify survival outcomes.

## Getting Started
To start with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-ml-from-disaster.git
   cd titanic-ml-from-disaster
   ```

2. **Install Requirements:**
   Ensure Python is installed, then create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   The primary analysis and model-building steps are documented in `Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster Competition Project.ipynb`. Open and run this notebook to see the full analysis.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project is the [Titanic passenger dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) from Kaggle, which includes various features related to passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. Key features include:

- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Ticket fare
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

## Methodology
The project workflow follows these key steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualization of survival rates across different features
   - Correlation analysis to identify important features
   - Summary statistics to gain insights into data distribution

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values in age, cabin, and embarked columns
   - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., sex, embarked)
   - Feature scaling for model compatibility

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Creation of new features such as family size, title extraction, and fare per person
   - Binning of continuous variables to capture non-linear relationships

4. **Model Building:**
   - **Algorithms used**: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and others
   - **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning and Cross-Validation:**
   - Grid search and cross-validation to optimize model parameters
   - Comparison of model performance to select the best model

## Results
The results of each model are documented in the notebook. Key findings include:

- Insights into which features (e.g., gender, passenger class, age) have the strongest correlation with survival
- Model evaluation results showing which algorithm performs best for this classification task
- Discussion of challenges, such as handling missing data and imbalanced classes

## Usage
To replicate the analysis or modify the model:

1. Open the `Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster Competition Project.ipynb` notebook.
2. Follow the steps outlined to preprocess the data, build models, and evaluate results.
3. Modify parameters or try new models as needed to explore the dataset further.
